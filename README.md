# Battery-Heat-Simulation
Python script which calculates the heat generated and temperature rise of busbars in a high voltage battery pack.

User need to input custom busbar surface area parameters and ideal rates of heat transfer based off fan speeds. Simplified heat tranfer as air over a plate using Nusselts formulas.

Example of output plot:
